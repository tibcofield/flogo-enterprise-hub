## Introduction

With **TIBCO Flogo®  Agentic AI and the **TIBCO Platform Model Context Protocol (MCP) Services** enterprises can now build autonomous goal driven **AI-Agents**, enabling secure, intelligent automation across CRM, order management, and communication systems.

This demo showcases how Flogo AI Agent Activity can assist you in problem determination and error handling of applications running in the TIBCO platform, as an **AI-powered Alert Agent**.

## Demo Overview

 **In this demonstration, we build an **Autonomous AI agent** using the Flogo AI Agent activity. 
 It illustrates how the MCP services of TIBCO Platform can be used as **Tools**.** And work together to connect AI models (like Claude or OpenAI model) in the Agentic context.

The scenario starts in TIBCO Platform, where the Alerts configuration is used to monitor error situations on Flogo applications deployed in platform. When the alert conditions are met, the TIBCO Platform will send an alert to the AI Agent for further error investigation. For communication the newly introduced Webhook support from platform version 1.17 is used to communicate to the Flogo AI Agent. 

The **TIBCO Platform MCP services** helping the autonomous AI Agent to collect relevant data on the erroneous application. The AI Agent Reports back its findings in logged response.
This is done by a multi step approach fed into the user prompt of the AI Agent.

```
Perform the following steps to work to an answer:  

Step 1: From the received email. Determine the  application name and 'affected DP' data plane name that has produced the error from the alert message.
Step 2: Find the application in the 'Affected DP' data plane and determine the dataplaneid that runs this application. Retrieve the 'application name' from the alert message.
Step 3: Determine via the right tool if the 'applicationId' in the 'dataplaneId'  is a 'FLOGO', 'BWCE' or a 'BW5CE' application type.
Step 4: Determine the application runtime status of the faulty application with the 'applicationId'.
Step 5: Gather all other application information that can be found using the tools on 'applicationId' and 'data-plane-id' 
Step 6: Try to find the error in the Observability and trace information of this application with the 'applicationId' and 'data-plane-id'. 
Create a nice overview of all relevant data from the application causing the error notification. Summarize in plain text, show these details in the summary: 'Alert name', 'Alert Description', 'Event Type', 'Value', 'Timestamp', 'Affected DP', 'DataplaneId', 'Capability Type', 'Affected app', 'Runtime Status of the Affected app', 'Alert message'.
```

### TIBCO Platform events

The alerts and notifications in TIBCO Control Plane improve user visibility into system events, failures, and performance thresholds, enhancing overall operational awareness and reducing response time to critical issues.

The platform 1.17 release introduces a new Webhook receiver for alert notification. This feature allows you to integrate alert notifications with external systems using a standardized JSON payload.
This scenario uses this new functionality to communicate between the TIBCO Platform and the Flogo AI Agent.

 The Alert configuration in TIBCO Platform consist of two parts. First you need to configure the Alert Receivers, in our use case the webhook endpoint, which is the public webhook URL of the deployed AI Agent in Flogo.

>Please Note: You will only have the public webhook URL after deployment of the Flogo AI Agent and after exposing the endpoint as a public accessible endpoint. When successfully done so, you can copy the public endpoint from the deployed Flogo Application and add the Context Path of the trigger request to this.

The second part of the configuration is the definition of the Alert itself. This is done via the 
"+ Configure Alert" button in the Alerts part of the Control Plane menu. 

#### Alert Receiver definition

Via the Global Configuration settings, the Alert Receivers can be configured for email and webhook alerting.

The webhook definition in this AI Agentic scenario points to the endpoint URL of the AI Agent Flogo implementation. In this case it is also running in a TIBCO Platform data plane under the Flogo capability.

#### Alert Definition

For this AI Agentic scenario an Error Event for Flogo Applications was created with the following settings.

This Alert will be evaluated every 5 minutes. When the Alert Rule is evaluated to true, the alert will be sent to the configured Alert Receivers.
### TIBCO Platform MCP Servers

MCP (Model Context Protocol) is an open-source standard for connecting AI applications to external systems. TIBCO® Control Plane MCP server connects AI applications to TIBCO Control Plane. This gives AI applications the ability to process TIBCO Control Plane, data plane, and capabilities data by using natural language interactions.

The Tools provided by the TIBCO Platform MCP Servers are called by the AI Agent for collecting relevant information when reasoning and executing the AI-Prompts. 

In the TIBCO platform these MCP Servers should be enabled in the TIBCO Control Plane -> Settings - MCP Servers.

### Flogo Agentic AI

The new TIBCO Flogo® Connector for Agentic AI - Tech Preview enables developers to build and orchestrate intelligent, AI-driven agentic workflows within the Flogo ecosystem. It allows you to seamlessly combine LLM-powered decision-making with deterministic business workflows, bringing intelligence, adaptability, and context-awareness to automation flows.
  
With built-in support for LLM connections, agent triggers, agent invocation, and tool integrations, the connector empowers you to design both orchestration agents and domain-specific agents that can autonomously coordinate tasks, retrieve data, and make contextual decisions.

### Running the scenario


#### Running using the Platform event trigger

In order to create an error event for testing, I created a simple Flogo Application to trigger errors.
This Flogo sample application is also available under the source directory in the GIT repository.
When the alert rule is evaluated to true, the error alert will be sent by the TIBCO platform to the configured alert receiver.

>Note: Running this ErrorAlertTrigger sample can interfere with the other applications in your data plane. When you want to test intensively with Alert Triggers and the AI Agent or if you want to unit test the AI Agent application, you can use the manual trigger solution described below.

#### Manual trigger

Alternatively the scenario can also be triggered manually, by sending the following payload over the Webhook HTTP Trigger. A REST POST command on the Webhook Trigger URL from the FLOGO Agent Flow will do the trick and get the Agent to work for you.

---

## Runtime Configuration

### System properties

- **FLOGO_OTEL_TRACE:** true  
- **FLOGO_LOG_LEVEL:** ERROR  

This means OpenTelemetry tracing appears to be enabled for the app, and the application log level is configured to capture errors.

### Resource limits

**Requests:**

- CPU: 250m
- Memory: 512Mi

**Limits:**

- CPU: 500m
- Memory: 1Gi

### Scaling

- **Autoscaling enabled:** false
- **Service mesh enabled:** false
- **Execution history enabled:** false

Because execution history is disabled, detailed execution history may not be available through the Flogo capability.

---

## Observability / Trace Investigation

I could not directly query Observability or trace records because no Observability or trace search tool is available in the current toolset.

However, the application configuration shows:

- **FLOGO_OTEL_TRACE = true**
- **FLOGO_LOG_LEVEL = ERROR**

So the application is configured to emit trace data and error-level logs. The next recommended investigation step would be to search Observability logs/traces for:

- **Application ID:** d5577mu7j5sc73efljg0
- **Application name:** mle-erroralerttrigger
- **Namespace:** nlpresales-ns
- **Data plane ID:** cq1duk2jcp26pefl1d60
- **Pod name:** mle-erroralerttrigger-58d459696d-qhwzs
- **Timestamp around:** 2026-05-28T09:07:16Z
- **Event type:** FaultPercentage
- **Severity:** Critical

---

## Plain Text Summary

A critical Flogo error alert was triggered for application **mle-erroralerttrigger** running on data plane **DP4_PresalesNL**. The alert rule was **FaultPercentage >= 1% over 1 minute**, and the reported value was **100**, meaning the application experienced a very high percentage of faulty executions during the alert window.

The affected application was identified using the application ID **d5577mu7j5sc73efljg0** from the alert. It is a **FLOGO** application running in namespace **nlpresales-ns** on data plane **cq1duk2jcp26pefl1d60**. The current application runtime status is **Running**, and its pod instance is also **Running**.

The application exposes a public endpoint at:

https://flogo.mle.atsnl-emea.azure.dataplanes.pro/tibco/apps/errorAlertTrigger/ReceiveHTTPMessage

Although the app is currently running, the alert indicates it produced runtime faults. OpenTelemetry tracing is enabled, and log level is set to ERROR, but execution history is disabled. Further analysis should be performed in Observability using the application ID, pod name, namespace, and alert timestamp.
